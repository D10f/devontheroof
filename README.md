# Welcome

[Developer Sojourn](https://developersojourn.site) is my personal site to experiment and learn more about all things web. I attempt to put into practice new ideas and using new technologies to me. I will also write about my personal experience learning web development and programming topics, but mostly this will be my go-to place to write notes to refresh my memory.

This portfolio is a work in progress and it will always be, as I change things around to stay up with design trends, throw in new technologies to the current stack and find other overly complicated ways to have some fun with code.
