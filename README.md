Hi, there!

I'm the [Dev On The Roof](https://devontheroof.top) and this my personal site, an ever work in progress where I attempt to put into practice new ideas and technologies that I find interesting.

From time to time I write about my personal experiences while learning about web development, design and other programming topics, but mostly you'll find notes about *the thing* that I'm currently working on. 

In summary, this is where I come to find overly complicated ways of having fun with code. Feel free to stick around and enjoy the view.

# TODO:
- [ ] Add illustration with a nice view.
- [ ] Write instructions to setup theme dev environment.
- [ ] Write instructions to setup custom block dev environment.
- [ ] Create IAC (infrastructure-as-code) section.
- [ ] Undo production step on Dockerfile in favor of bind volumes during deployment
