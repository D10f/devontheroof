      THIS FILE EXISTS FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY!

      Add a new img, svg, video or any other media element that is not loaded
      dynamically through WordPress. Adding a media resource here will be picked
      up by Webpack, and served during development, or bundled during build.

      Ideally this file would be empty and all assets handled by WordPress. But
      this makes it very easy during local development and testing, without
      affecting the bundle size or response times once deployed in production.
